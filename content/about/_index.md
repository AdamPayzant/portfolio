Hi, I'm Edward Adam Payzant. I'm currently a fourth year computer science student at Carleton University.
I'm a dual US-Canadian citizen and was born in the US before moving to Canada (and I have a weird mixed accent to go along with it).

# Interests

## Distributed Operating Systems
A lot of my recent focus has been on distributed operating systems experimenting with Plan 9, as well as working on creating a distributed file system using grpc and libfuse.
Distributed OS's are fascinating because they both allow software to be better system agnostic, as well as creating an interesting user experience with the software more abstracted away from the hardware the user is on.

## System Security
Through various classes at Carleton, I've been studying how to make a system more secure and how to research vulnerabilities.
Devices are gaining increasing network capabilities while also having an ever increasing importance in our daily lives, meaning security is more important than ever.
My security interests include trust and authentication, encryption for both local storage and transmission, and risk minimization.

## Low Level and Embedded Programming
I've worked at the kernel level on various occasions, and have also done some simple Arduino programming to build a custom wireless keyboard.
I've been daily-ing Arch Linux, a more user involved Linux distro, and experimented with Gentoo Linux (though the compile times scared me away) and have been experimenting writing kernel modules and rootkits.

## AI and Machine Learning
This is a pretty trendy topic and I've jumped on the bandwagon. While most of my experience comes from more traditional AI or from statistical analysis, I have some experience with deep learning through convolutional neural networks. I'm most interested in the underlying math and theory that machine learning comes from, and enjoy trying to find the best tool for the job.

## Optimization
This is less so a single subject and moreso the way I like to program. I'm always intrigued trying to find out more performant ways of writing specific code, as well as learning how to utilize compiler optimizations. This includes subjects like parallelization, where single core performance may be negatively affected but real world performance is improved.

# FAQ

## How'd I build this site?

This site was built using Hugo, and a more detailed description can be [found on my blog](/post/webbuilding).

## VIM or Emacs?

I prefer VIM when I want something lightweight (or I'm remote), and VS Code fills what I would want Emacs for.
